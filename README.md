# minittify

An ongoing project to easily convert color scheme config files between terminals. Currently supports conversion from [terminator](https://launchpad.net/terminator) to [mintty](https://github.com/mintty/mintty).

### Usage

`python minttify.py -f [terminator config file]`

This will create an equivalent `.minttyrc` file with the same filename as the input file.
